## Flask Application Design for Pension Agency Enhancement

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: The main page of the application. It will present users with a form to enter their pension information. The form will include fields for name, social security number, and date of birth.

### Routes

- **@app.route('/pension-form', methods=['POST'])**: This route will handle the submission of the pension form. It will retrieve the data entered by the user and store it in a database.

- **@app.route('/pension-results')**: This route will display the results of the user's pension calculation. It will retrieve the user's data from the database and calculate their estimated pension benefits.

- **@app.route('/about')**: This route will provide information about the application and its purpose.

- **@app.route('/contact')**: This route will provide contact information for the application developers.

### Additional Features

In addition to the basic functionality described above, the application could also include the following features:

- **User authentication**: This would allow users to create accounts and securely access their pension information.

- **Secure data storage**: This would ensure that the user's pension data is stored securely and is not accessible to unauthorized individuals.

- **Integration with external APIs**: This would allow the application to access data or services from other systems, such as the Social Security Administration's database.

### Earning Revenue

There are several ways that the application could be used to generate revenue:

- **Subscription fees**: Users could be charged a monthly or annual fee to access the application's features.

- **Advertising**: The application could display advertisements to users who are not subscribed.

- **Partnerships with financial institutions**: The application could partner with financial institutions to offer additional services, such as investment advice or financial planning.

By implementing these features and revenue models, the application could provide a valuable service to users while also generating revenue for the developers.
